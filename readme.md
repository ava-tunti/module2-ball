##Moving Ball Simulation
You can see the simulation here: [moving balls](https://ava-tunti.github.io/module2-ball/)

The simulation makes a singular ball bounce from one corner to the other. It changes color by choosing RGB values at random. It also changes size at random, at each bounce. After each bounce, it also displays the text 'BOUNCE!' as a fun text effect. No installation steps required. Just click the link above. 

This was a fun exercise to practice different coding skills. It could be used as a template to practice your own coding or just to watch and have fun with. If you have any questions or comments on the project, you can leave a comment here.

I would like to make the ball look nicer, as well as the box in which the ball bounces around in, making it easier on the eyes in general.

Feel free to use this code to your own preferences and applications, no restrictions.
